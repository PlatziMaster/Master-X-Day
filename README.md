# Master X Day - FRONTEND


Team 12

We create our prototype in Adobe XD, we decided this was the best because Adobe XD is really easy to use.
We search many inspiration on the internet and we did team back to tell our ideas.

In the future we would love to do this for desktop and tablet, in this first stage we are only focus in the mobile.

We read the documentation for connecting the API.
