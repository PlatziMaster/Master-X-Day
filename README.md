### Is the design of your prototype complete?
- [X] Must show how many cards are contained in a list.
- [X] It should not require login, user management, roles or authentication system.
- [X] Must display the progress percentage of a project according to the total number of cards vs the amount of "completed" cards and "in-progress" cards.
- [X] Must display corresponding percentage to every stage: % of to do tasks, % of tasks in progress. % of completed tasks.
- [ ] Percentages must also be displayed in plots (graphs).
- [ ] The application must be deployed, we suggest the use of Heroku.

- Filter Functionality
- Search bar : For the tasks that have been created
- Authentication
- Create different projects 
- Responsive Design
- Accessibility
- Dark mode

### Describe other alternatives that you considered:
The winners are in     bold text
    - JavaScript Vanilla vs React: well, first we could do a vanilla js app, but it will take us more time
    - Vue vs Svelt vs  React : We decided to use react instead of vue or svelte because we had already worked with react, so the development would be faster
    - CSS vs Framework: We use Bootstrap and SCSS a preprocessor to go as fast as we can

### How did you connect to the API?
We`re going to use Axios connect to the API
