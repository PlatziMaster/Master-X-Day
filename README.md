## Phase 1: Design of the project

### Is the design of your prototype complete?

In this stage of the hackathon through the use of Figma each member of the team generated one approach to the design of the web application, once the brainstorm was done, a design system was chosen by all members of the team. In this stage, we started designing all the different pages of the project according to the selected design system of the team, such as font family and base elements. We have divided the tasks in mobile layout and desktop layout. In conclusion, our design is done but it lacks some details in interactivity.

### How would you improve this phase in the future?

Since several team members haven't worked with Figma, not all the elements and benefits that these software offers are known, so in the future, we could generate better interfaces by thinking a little more about color palettes, a better component design system, and some changes on the main design. We could also add interactions with the tools provided by Figma to generate a better prototype.

### Describe other alternatives that you considered:

We used Figma because we can work together instead of Adobe XD, also this program has integration in the web navigator so this can be much easier to manage and work with. Also, some of the team members uses Linux OS they can't use Adobe XD.

### How did you connect to the API?

At first, we visited the documentation of the Trello API, we generated the required keys to make the connection and then, we used the postman to test and analyze the API content as well as to validate the keys we had obtained.

The key and the token were generated at https://trello.com/app-key and using the Postman tool we analyzed the following URLs.

- https://api.trello.com/1/members/me/boards?fields=name,url&key={apiKey}&token={apiToken}
