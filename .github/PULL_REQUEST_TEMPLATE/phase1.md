## Phase I: Design of the project

### FIGMA prototype and API connection

**Is the design of your prototype complete?**
We used figma to develop the template, the advantage was that it can be worked and edited online by the whole team

**How would you improve this phase in the future?**
with enough time we could make the interface animate, that is, a more friendly graphical user interface where elements can be dragged and much more

**Describe other alternatives that you considered:**
an alternative was to use Adobe XD or Photoshop but since the requirement was to use figma, we used it.
In the case of the API, the use of POSTMAN is easier to check the operation of an API

**How did you connect to the API?**
First we looked for documentation / videos about using the Trello api, then we used postman to test the endopoins of the api with the key and token, with that we were able to put the board, the lists and even the cards in the lists, so that we can put that information in our interface
