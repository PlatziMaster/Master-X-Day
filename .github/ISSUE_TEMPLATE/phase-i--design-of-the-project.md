**Is the design of your prototype complete?**

A clear and concise description of how you accomplished this task. 
_Eg. I used FIGMA and adobe XD to..._

We used FIGMA because it is an online platform where we can access together and collaborate, it is easy to use it.

Our project is made in three different parts.
Fist of all we can show numbers of task (to do, in progress and done) using cards.

Then at the right side we can show two differents cards that let's us identify the progresss of the project.

At the end, we can show the pie-chart about how is the percentage of the different list (to do, in progress and done). about the project

And head Our logo of Platzi :D

**How would you improve this phase in the future?**
A clear and concise description of what else would you do.

Even thought the time was liitle , we can improve our design in colors, distribution and images.

**Describe other alternatives that you considered:**
Explain why you chose your current methods.

Accoring to pie-chart we thought it is a beeter option because that show all percentages of the differents steps. So pie chart it is easy to read. The other cards it is informative!

**How did you connect to the API?**
Provide details about the process that you followed in this step.

We can connect API with our project through key and tokens, to do that we want to use fetch method of JavaScript 
We will use http verbs like get
