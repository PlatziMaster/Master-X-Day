**Mockup the 60% of your project**
Our site has all components that we design in the phase 1. The project hasn't styles yet, but we add these features in phase 3

**Connect to the API**


**Your site contains accessibility and a responsive design**
We use CSS Grid Layout for Responsive and the library that we use for the pie charts is ApexChart and it's a responsive support.
